Wow, you are actually reading this! Glad to hear.

This program backups your minecraft settings and saves them on the MC-BACKUPS folder which will
appear once you start the program, on the same folder. Type "S" or "Save" to save as recent a
recent backup and type load to load that recent backup. If you want to make multiple backups,
type "create profile" or you for quicker "create profile [profile name]", settings will
automatically be saved in that profile, but you can also type "save in" to save your recent
settings on that profile. To load a profile, type "load profile" or "load profile [profile]"
The maximum amount of profiles you can make is 27. You cannot make a backup with more than 29 letters
and you cannot use any special character rather than _ and -.

If you want an easier explanation of how to use this, read the "guide.txt" file.

If this is the first time you are using a program from HTS, you will notice that a folder
has appeard on your %APPDATA% by the name HTS_DATA. There we save all the data our programs
made so they can remember, in other words, saves.

This program is using only the directories "%APPDATA%\.minecraft\", "%APPDATA%\HTS_STUDIOS\" and "... \MC-BACKUPS\*"

If you want to change the targetted minecraft directory (which as default is "%APPDATA%\.minecraft"),
type "change directory". If directory was not found on start up, it will require you to change it.
The minecraft directory will change as long the file "options.txt" exists in it.
To reset the directory back to "%APPDATA%\.minecraft" type "Reset Directory"

There are some developer commands, such as "Open Directory", "Open Backups", "Open Logs" and "Open Minecraft".
These will just open the directories, you can freely use them.

If you resized it and broke the layout, type "fix" to fix it, or you can just restart it.
